# Stock Trader
This repository holds the umbrella helm chart for the IBM Stock Trader sample (see the sibling `stocktrader-operator` repository for the equivalent umbrella operator, for use with the OpenShift Container Platform).  Note that you may wish to also follow along with the blog post I recently made about how to use this helm chart:
https://medium.com/cloud-engagement-hub/using-an-umbrella-helm-chart-to-deploy-the-composite-ibm-stock-trader-sample-3b8b69af900d

The IBM Stock Trader application is a simple stock trading sample where you can create various stock portfolios and add shares of stock to each for a commission.
It keeps track of each porfolio's total value and its loyalty level which affects the commission charged per transaction.
It sends notifications of changes in loyalty level.
It also lets you submit feedback on the application which can result in earning free (zero commission) trades, based on the tone of the feedback.

The broker microservice sits at the center of the application.  This microservice 
* calls the portfolio microservice, which persists portfolios using JDBC and calls the stock-quote microservice
* calls the account microservice, which persists accounts to Cloudant and drives calls to ODM and JMS 
* calls the trade-history microservice, which persists trades to Mongo

There is a Message Driven Bean (MDB) which listens for the messages sent from account and which invokes a notification microservice.
There are 2 notification microservices: 
* notification-slack which sends the notification to a Slack channel (using a "serverless" IBM Cloud Functions action sequence)
* notification-twitter which sends the notification as a tweet to a Twitter account

Both use the same service called `notification-service`.
If you do not have Istio in your cluster, you need to choose which microservice to deploy.
If you have Istio in your cluster, you can deploy both.
You must manually create the Istio routing rules (see the notification-slack and notification-twitter projects for samples).

## Prerequisites

* IBM Cloud Private installed
* IBM Cloud public account (trial account can be used)

The following installation instructions guide you through installing the dependent software (DB2, MQ, etc) and configuring it for use by the
stocktrader application.  After the dependent software is installed and configured, the stocktrader application is installed.

## General preparation for installation

Clone this project so that you can run the configuration scripts from your workstation.

After cloning this project, clone the other stocktrader projects as siblings of this project since they are needed by some of the configuration scripts.
You can do so by running `./stocktrader/scripts/cloneProjects.sh` from the same working directory
where you cloned this project.

You need to be logged in to your IBM Cloud Private instance via the CLI when running any of the configuration scripts.
See [these instructions](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_2.1.0.3/manage_cluster/cli_commands.html#pr_login).

The following instructions and the configuration scripts assume that you will deploy the stocktrader application in the `stocktrader` Kubernetes namespace.
If you want to use a different namespace, then update your copy of the `variables.sh` file in the `scripts` folder to change the desired namespace.
Also use that namespace in any kubectl commands provided below in place of `stocktrader`.

## Install and configure DB2

1. Log in to your IBM Cloud Private management console.
2. Click the `Catalog` button.
3. Type `db2` into the search bar to find the IBM Db2 Developer-C Helm chart.  Click on the chart.
4. Perform the prerequisites for DB2 installation as directed by the chart's instructions.
5. Click the `Configure` button to display the chart's configuration parameters.
    * Set the database name to `trader`.

    * Log in to your public IBM Cloud account using the `ibmcloud login` command.
    * Set your Cloud Foundry org and space using the `ibmcloud target --cf` command.
    * Set the current directory to the `scripts` folder.
    * Run the `./setupCloudFunctions.sh` script.
    This script creates an IBM Cloud Function action sequence to post a message to your Slack workspace and tests it.
4. Run the following commands.

    ```console
    ibmcloud fn action get stocktrader/PostLoyaltyLevelToSlack --url

    ibmcloud fn property get --auth
    ```

    The first command displays the URL of the cloud function that was created.
    The second command displays your credentials (id and password) for invoking the cloud function.

5. Change the kubectl context to your ICP instance.
Run the following command.

    ```console
    kubectl create secret generic openwhisk --from-literal=url=<URL> --from-literal=id=<ID> --from-literal=pwd=<PASSWORD> -n stocktrader

    ```

    where `<CONSUMER_KEY>`, `<CONSUMER_SECRET>`, `<ACCESS_TOKEN>` and `<ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET>` are obtained from Twitter following successful creation of your Twitter app.

## Install stocktrader Helm chart

1. [Set up the Helm CLI to work with IBM Cloud Private.](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_2.1.0.3/app_center/create_helm_cli.html)
2. Review the values.yaml file.  By default the tradr (node.js application), notification-slack, notification-twitter and trade-history projects are not deployed.
If you want to deploy any of those projects, you will need to request it via command-line option or via your own values yaml file.
3. Install the chart.
Here is a sample helm install command.

    ```console
    helm install stocktrader --tls --name stocktrader --namespace stocktrader --set notificationSlack.enabled=true
    ```

    This command creates a Helm release named `stocktrader`.  The Kubernetes resources are created in a namespace called `stocktrader`.
    The ``--set`` argument shows how to deploy an optional project, in this case notification-slack.
